    <h1>Build or Rent</h1>
    <p>Many web developers use code on yor website that that come from ouside your site and that you have no control over. They use tackers and "performance monitoring" software to enhance your experience. You agree to this in thier rental agreement ("Terms of Use").  </p>
    <h3>Avantages of owning your code</h3>
    <p><ul>
            <li><b>No recurring fees!</b>Many web developers will charge you monthly for hosting and access to services. A better option for simple static sites is to have the code written and deploy it to the internet using a free or low cost hosting provider. </li>
            <li>Many developers will use third party APIs to build your website. This is easier for them to build and reduces the upfront costs, but you pay more in the long term through monthly fees.</li>
            <li>It's yours. You can change it any way you like</li>
            <li>You can take it with you if you want to change hosting providers, or developrs</li>
            <li>Only using code you own reduces your risk for data breaches by keeping it safe within your website. </li>
            <li>Know where your data is, so only you can control who accesses it  </li>
            <li>Your paying for it. Why not own it?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher upfront costs</li>
            <li>Complex sites (sites with data stores, Asynchronous connections or dependancies like connections to email or texting services) use servise that charge monthly or per use making them ill suited for a one-time fee structure.</li>
            <li>Are usually more expensive</li>
        </ul>
